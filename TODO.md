# TODO: Fix ForestScene.ts TypeScript Errors

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Convert the React Quiz component to a Phaser.Scene class extending Phaser.Scene
- [x] Remove all React imports and JSX syntax
- [x] Implement quiz display using Phaser's text objects for questions and labels
- [x] Create DOM input elements for user answers, positioned over the Phaser canvas
- [x] Implement submit button using Phaser text with interactivity
- [x] Calculate and display score after submission
- [x] Handle the timer passed from IntroScene (display remaining time or something)
- [x] Ensure the scene transitions properly (e.g., to next scene after quiz)

## Followup Steps

- [ ] Test the scene by running the game and navigating to ForestScene
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors remain
- [ ] Adjust styling and positioning as needed for better UX
